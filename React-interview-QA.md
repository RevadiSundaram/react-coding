# React

# Virtual DOM

# Why React is Fast

# Why React is not comaring real dom with virtual dom
- Real DOM tags has like 1000 properties inside a tag
- But virtual DOM has like 10 properties so it is diff to compare

# Diff btw state and useState
- 

# why useEffect will give warnings with async
-
